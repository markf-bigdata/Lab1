The questions we are trying to answer are: How old/young is the oldest and youngest persons working for the City of Seattle? What is the average age of the workers? What is the lowest wage of an employee? What is the highest wage of an employee? What is the average wage of the employees?"

I also found that the lowest wage of an employee is \\\\$5.53, the highest wage is \\\\$163.84 and the average wage is \\\\$40.03. This lets me come to the conclusion that there is a wide variety of ages of employees who work for the city of Seattle, and that the city of Seattle tends to pay its employees well, with its average wage being roughly \\\\$40. This dataset has also raised some questions for me, such as:\n",
    "- Is it legal to only get paid \\\\$5.53 an hour?\n",
    "- Is it legal for someone only 14 years old to work?\n",
    "- What does the 92 year old employee do for work?\n",
